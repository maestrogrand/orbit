# Software Architecture Orbit AI Ops Assistant

## Overview

Orbit is a terminal-based, AI-powered DevOps assistant designed to unify and simplify workflows for managing multiple AWS accounts, Terraform configurations, Kubernetes clusters, Helm deployments, and Okta integrations. This document outlines the software architecture, covering all features, functionalities, and workflows.

## System Architecture

### High-Level Architecture

Orbit follows a modular, layered architecture to ensure scalability, extensibility, and maintainability. Each layer represents a distinct concern:

1.  CLI Layer: User-facing command-line interface for interacting with Orbit.
2.  Application Layer: Core logic for processing commands and managing workflows.
3.  Integration Layer: Interfaces with external systems (AWS, Kubernetes, Terraform, Helm, Okta).
4.  Data Layer: Manages configuration files, secrets, and session data securely.

## Core Components

### 1. CLI Layer

- Responsibilities:

- Parse and process user commands.
- Provide natural language support.
- Offer intelligent auto-completion.
- Technologies:

- Python Typer framework.

### 2. Application Layer

#### Workspace Manager

- Manages named workspaces for multi-environment configurations.
- Handles automatic loading of AWS, Kubernetes, and Terraform states.

Key APIs:  
def create_workspace(name: str):

pass

def switch_workspace(name: str):

- pass

#### Workflow Automation

- Executes YAML-defined workflows.
- Integrates multiple commands into a single pipeline.

Key APIs:  
workflows:

deploy-infra:

- aws: switch dev-account

- tf: apply

- k8s: switch prod-cluster

- - helm: deploy app-release

#### AI Orchestrator

- Learns user behavior and suggests actions.
- Proactively identifies and resolves issues.
- Example:  
  Suggestion: Would you like to run `terraform apply`? [Yes/No]

#### Security Module

- Encrypts sensitive data (e.g., secrets, credentials).
- Handles automatic cleanup of temporary files.

### 3. Integration Layer

- Provides interfaces for external tools and APIs.
- Key Interfaces:

- AWS SDK for Python.
- Kubernetes Python Client or kubectl wrapper.
- Terraform and Helm CLI integrations.
- Okta API for authentication and session management.

### 4. Data Layer

- Encrypted Storage:

- Stores sensitive data (tokens, keys) securely.
- Uses AES encryption for local storage.

- Configuration Management:

- YAML files for workspaces and workflows.

Example workspace configuration:  
workspace:

name: dev

aws_profile: dev-profile

kubernetes_context: dev-cluster

- terraform_state: s3://dev-tf-state

## Workflows

### Use Case: Deploy a New Feature

1.  Switch Workspace:  
    Orbit workspace switch feature-x

- Loads AWS profile, Kubernetes context, and Terraform state.

3.  Apply Infrastructure Changes:  
    Orbit tf apply

- Runs terraform apply with pre-loaded configurations.

5.  Deploy Helm Chart:  
    Orbit helm deploy my-app

- Deploys Helm chart with real-time feedback.

7.  Monitor Kubernetes Pods:  
    Orbit k8s logs --follow

- Streams logs for troubleshooting.

9.  Clean Up Credentials:  
    Orbit logout

- Clears session tokens and temporary files.
