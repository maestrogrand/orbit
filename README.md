## Project Overview

Orbit enables developers and operations teams to manage cloud infrastructure, orchestrate workflows, and troubleshoot issues efficiently using an intuitive command-line interface. By leveraging AI and modern DevOps tools, Orbit bridges the gap between manual operations and fully automated pipelines.

### Key Features

1.  **Workspace Management**

    - Create, switch, and manage named workspaces for multi-environment configurations.
    - Automatically load AWS profiles, Kubernetes contexts, and Terraform states.

2.  **Workflow Automation**

    - Define multi-step workflows in YAML files for seamless execution.
    - Execute commands in sequence with built-in error handling and rollback.

3.  **AI-Powered Suggestions**

    - Receive intelligent recommendations based on historical usage patterns.
    - Proactively troubleshoot issues and suggest fixes.

4.  **Integration with Key DevOps Tools**

    - **AWS**: Manage multiple accounts and roles with ease.
    - **Kubernetes**: Switch contexts, stream logs, and manage pods.
    - **Terraform**: Safely apply or destroy configurations.
    - **Helm**: Deploy, upgrade, and rollback Helm charts.
    - **Okta**: Securely authenticate and retrieve session tokens.

5.  **Security and Encryption**

    - Securely manage credentials, tokens, and secrets with AES encryption.
    - Implement automatic session cleanup and timeout management.

## Core Functionalities

### Workspace Management

Define and manage environments with ease:

`workspace:
  name: production
  aws_profile: prod-profile
  kubernetes_context: prod-cluster
  terraform_state: s3://prod-terraform-state`

### Workflow Orchestration

Simplify complex pipelines with YAML workflows:

```yaml
workflows
  deploy-infra:
    - aws: switch dev-account
    - tf: apply
    - k8s: switch prod-cluster
    - helm: deploy app-release`
```

### AI-Driven Insights

- **Command Suggestions**: "Would you like to run `terraform plan`? [Yes/No]"
- **Error Resolution**: "Detected pod crash. Suggested fix: restart pod or scale deployment."

### Security by Design

- **Encrypted Storage**: Securely store secrets and configurations.
- **Automatic Cleanup**: Ensure temporary files and session data are cleaned after use.
